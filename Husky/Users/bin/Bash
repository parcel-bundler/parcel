The number e, also known as Euler's number, is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828 which can be characterized in many ways. It is the base of the natural logarithms. It is the limit of (1 + 1/n) as n approaches infinity, an expression that arises in the study of compound interest. It can also be calculated as the sum of the infinite series

The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators. While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing its cash hoard through stock and bond investments and share repurchases.

Standard +Consider Selling Price +Fair Value Uncertainty +Economic Moat +Stewardship Grade +03-11-2022 1 by Greggory Warren +Business Strategy & Outlook 03-11-2022 +While 2020 was an extremely difficult year for Berkshire Hathaway, with a nearly 10% decline in operating earnings and a more than 40% decline in reported net earnings, the firm's overall positioning improved as the back half of the year progressed. The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators. While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing its cash hoard through stock and bond investments and share repurchases.

Your email was received and a response to your question. I want you to know that your fund has been here since last week and we have made all the necessary arrangements on how to release your fund. NOTE: You have three ways which you can receive your fund and these three ways are BANK TO BANK WIRE TRANSFER, CHECK AND ATM CARD. So it is up to you to make your choice and then we will follow up. Be informed that we do not request for transfer charges or delivery charges but the only fee needed for this transaction to be completed is the sum of $675usd and it should be paid to the Country of Origin for the release of Fund Release Order Certificate and Affidavit Stamp and once this is been obtained from the Fund Origin Country, we will commence on the release of your fund without any more delay and latest in two days time your fund will get to you as we have set up all the needed strategies to enable you receive your fund through any means of your choice. Your urgent response is needed on this to enable us know if you are serious on this or not because we have many payment files to work on and we will not like to skip yours. NOTE: Do disregard any email you get from any impostors or offices claiming to be in possession of your funds, you are hereby advised only to be in contact with me as I have been given strict instructions to work under your care and give you guidelines until you receive your overdue funds. Also, you are to forward any emails you get from impostors directly to me so we could act upon, commence an investigation and give the advice to avoid being ripped off.

RECONCILIATION FROM REPORTED TO MANAGED BASIS
(in millions, except ratios)
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked
consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with other companies’ U.S. GAAP financial statements. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a
“managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. Refer to the notes on Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 28 for additional information on
managed basis.
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021, subject to certain restrictions. As a result, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new
common share repurchase program of $30 billion.

stock options and SARs.

of these refinements, the average VaR for each of the following reported components would have been different by the following amounts: CIB fixed income of $33 million, $15 million, $(11) million and $4 million, CIB Trading VaR of $30 million, $11 million, $(11) million and $5
million and CIB VaR of $29 million, $11 million, $(8) million and $6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively.
(d) CIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities, as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA. Refer to VaR measurement on pages 121–123 of the Firm’s 2019 Form 10-K, and pages 80–82
of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2020 for further information.
(e) Average portfolio VaR was less than the sum of the VaR of the components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect reflects the fact that the risks were not perfectly correlated.
(f) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
(a) In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed
basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each
case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a FTE basis.
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and
securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact
related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.
(b) Pre-provision profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing
the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.
(c) TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a
percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as
investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.
(d) The ratio of the wholesale and CIB’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, is calculated excluding loans accounted for at
fair value, loans held-for-sale, CIB’s trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful
assessment of the respective allowance coverage ratio.
(e) In addition to reviewing net interest income and the net yield on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets to assess the performance of the
Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. The resulting metrics are referred to as non-markets related net interest income and net
yield. CIB Markets are Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of non-markets related net interest income and net yield provide investors and
analysts with other measures by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are
primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.

RECONCILIATION FROM REPORTED TO MANAGED BASIS
(in millions, except ratios)
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked
consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with other companies’ U.S. GAAP financial statements. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a
“managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. Refer to the notes on Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 28 for additional information on
managed basis.
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

(a) The capital metrics reflect the relief provided by the Federal Reserve Board in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the CECL capital transition provisions that became effective in the first quarter of 2020. For the periods ended December 31, 2020, September 30,
2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, the impact of the CECL capital transition provisions resulted in an increase to CET1 capital of $5.7 billion, $6.4 billion, $6.5 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. The SLR reflects the temporary exclusions of U.S. Treasury securities and
deposits at Federal Reserve Banks that became effective in the second quarter of 2020. Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 11-12 and Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the

(a) On March 15, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020. On
December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021, subject to certain restrictions. As a result, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new
common share repurchase program of $30 billion.
(b) The net impact of employee issuances on stockholders’ equity is driven by the cost of equity compensation awards that is recognized over the applicable vesting periods. The cost is partially offset by tax impacts related to the distribution of shares and the exercise of employee
stock options and SARs.

(a) Client deposits and other third-party liabilities pertain to the Wholesale Payments and Securities Services businesses.
(b) Represents total merchant processing volume across CIB, CCB and CB.

(c) Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude positions related to the risk management of interest rate exposure from changes in the Firm’s own credit spread on fair value option elected liabilities, and included these positions in other sensitivity-
based measures. Additionally, effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude certain asset-backed fair value option elected loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based measures to more effectively measure the risk from these loans. In the absence

of these refinements, the average VaR for each of the following reported components would have been different by the following amounts: CIB fixed income of $33 million, $15 million, $(11) million and $4 million, CIB Trading VaR of $30 million, $11 million, $(11) million and $5
million and CIB VaR of $29 million, $11 million, $(8) million and $6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively.
(d) CIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities, as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA. Refer to VaR measurement on pages 121–123 of the Firm’s 2019 Form 10-K, and pages 80–82
of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2020 for further information.
(e) Average portfolio VaR was less than the sum of the VaR of the components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect reflects the fact that the risks were not perfectly correlated.
(f) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
(a) In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed
basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each
case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a FTE basis.
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and
securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact
related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.
(b) Pre-provision profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing
the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.
(c) TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a
percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as
investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.
(d) The ratio of the wholesale and CIB’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, is calculated excluding loans accounted for at
fair value, loans held-for-sale, CIB’s trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful
assessment of the respective allowance coverage ratio.
(e) In addition to reviewing net interest income and the net yield on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets to assess the performance of the
Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. The resulting metrics are referred to as non-markets related net interest income and net
yield. CIB Markets are Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of non-markets related net interest income and net yield provide investors and
analysts with other measures by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are
primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.

RECONCILIATION FROM REPORTED TO MANAGED BASIS
(in millions, except ratios)
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked
consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with other companies’ U.S. GAAP financial statements. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a
“managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. Refer to the notes on Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 28 for additional information on
managed basis.
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

(a) The capital metrics reflect the relief provided by the Federal Reserve Board in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the CECL capital transition provisions that became effective in the first quarter of 2020. For the periods ended December 31, 2020, September 30,
2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, the impact of the CECL capital transition provisions resulted in an increase to CET1 capital of $5.7 billion, $6.4 billion, $6.5 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. The SLR reflects the temporary exclusions of U.S. Treasury securities and
deposits at Federal Reserve Banks that became effective in the second quarter of 2020. Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 11-12 and Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the

(a) On March 15, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020. On
December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021, subject to certain restrictions. As a result, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new
common share repurchase program of $30 billion.
(b) The net impact of employee issuances on stockholders’ equity is driven by the cost of equity compensation awards that is recognized over the applicable vesting periods. The cost is partially offset by tax impacts related to the distribution of shares and the exercise of employee
stock options and SARs.

of these refinements, the average VaR for each of the following reported components would have been different by the following amounts: CIB fixed income of $33 million, $15 million, $(11) million and $4 million, CIB Trading VaR of $30 million, $11 million, $(11) million and $5
million and CIB VaR of $29 million, $11 million, $(8) million and $6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively.
(d) CIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities, as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA. Refer to VaR measurement on pages 121–123 of the Firm’s 2019 Form 10-K, and pages 80–82
of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2020 for further information.
(e) Average portfolio VaR was less than the sum of the VaR of the components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect reflects the fact that the risks were not perfectly correlated.
(f) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
(a) In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed
basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each
case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a FTE basis.
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and
securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact
related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.
(b) Pre-provision profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing
the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.
(c) TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a
percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as
investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.
(d) The ratio of the wholesale and CIB’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, is calculated excluding loans accounted for at
fair value, loans held-for-sale, CIB’s trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful
assessment of the respective allowance coverage ratio.
(e) In addition to reviewing net interest income and the net yield on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets to assess the performance of the
Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. The resulting metrics are referred to as non-markets related net interest income and net
yield. CIB Markets are Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of non-markets related net interest income and net yield provide investors and
analysts with other measures by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are
primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.

RECONCILIATION FROM REPORTED TO MANAGED BASIS
(in millions, except ratios)
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked
consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with other companies’ U.S. GAAP financial statements. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a
“managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. Refer to the notes on Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 28 for additional information on
managed basis.
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

(a) The capital metrics reflect the relief provided by the Federal Reserve Board in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the CECL capital transition provisions that became effective in the first quarter of 2020. For the periods ended December 31, 2020, September 30,
2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, the impact of the CECL capital transition provisions resulted in an increase to CET1 capital of $5.7 billion, $6.4 billion, $6.5 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. The SLR reflects the temporary exclusions of U.S. Treasury securities and
deposits at Federal Reserve Banks that became effective in the second quarter of 2020. Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 11-12 and Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the

(a) On March 15, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020. On
December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021, subject to certain restrictions. As a result, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new
common share repurchase program of $30 billion.
(b) The net impact of employee issuances on stockholders’ equity is driven by the cost of equity compensation awards that is recognized over the applicable vesting periods. The cost is partially offset by tax impacts related to the distribution of shares and the exercise of employee
stock options and SARs.

(a) Client deposits and other third-party liabilities pertain to the Wholesale Payments and Securities Services businesses.
(b) Represents total merchant processing volume across CIB, CCB and CB.

(c) Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude positions related to the risk management of interest rate exposure from changes in the Firm’s own credit spread on fair value option elected liabilities, and included these positions in other sensitivity-
based measures. Additionally, effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude certain asset-backed fair value option elected loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based measures to more effectively measure the risk from these loans. In the absence

of these refinements, the average VaR for each of the following reported components would have been different by the following amounts: CIB fixed income of $33 million, $15 million, $(11) million and $4 million, CIB Trading VaR of $30 million, $11 million, $(11) million and $5
million and CIB VaR of $29 million, $11 million, $(8) million and $6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively.
(d) CIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities, as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA. Refer to VaR measurement on pages 121–123 of the Firm’s 2019 Form 10-K, and pages 80–82
of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2020 for further information.
(e) Average portfolio VaR was less than the sum of the VaR of the components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect reflects the fact that the risks were not perfectly correlated.
(f) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
(a) In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed
basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each
case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a FTE basis.
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and
securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact
related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.
(b) Pre-provision profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing
the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.
(c) TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a
percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as
investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.
(d) The ratio of the wholesale and CIB’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, is calculated excluding loans accounted for at
fair value, loans held-for-sale, CIB’s trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful
assessment of the respective allowance coverage ratio.
(e) In addition to reviewing net interest income and the net yield on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets to assess the performance of the
Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. The resulting metrics are referred to as non-markets related net interest income and net
yield. CIB Markets are Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of non-markets related net interest income and net yield provide investors and
analysts with other measures by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are
primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.

The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators. While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing When filing tax documents, ING payments, or replying to any related correspondence, it is very important that you use your EIN and complete name and address exactly as shown above.

We utilize our survey responses to address some of these questions and present specific findings in our answers.

The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators. While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing When filing tax documents, ING payments, or replying to any related correspondence, it is very important that you use your EIN and complete name and address exactly as shown above.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
GenesisAI Corporation

 

Opinion

 

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of GenesisAI Corporation (the Company) which comprises the balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements).

 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

 

Basis for Opinion

 

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

 

Substantial Doubt About the Company’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern

 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, the Company has net losses and has not yet generated any revenues, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s evaluation of the events and conditions and management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 5. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.

 

Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements

 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

 

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements, including omissions, are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.

 

FS-3

 

 

In performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, we:

 
        ●        Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.

 
        ●        Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

 
        ●        Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

 
        ●        Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.

 
        ●        Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.

 

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control related matters that we identified during the audit.

GENESISAI CORPORATION

Notes to the Financial Statements
Forthe Years Ended

December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020

 

NOTE 1- NATURE OF OPERATIONS

 

GenesisAI Corporation (“GenesisAI”, the “Company”, or “we”) was formed as a Delaware corporation on July 3, 2018. The Company’s headquarters are in Florida.

 

The Company develops and markets an online marketplace for artificial intelligence solutions and products.

 

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Basis of Presentation

 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”).

 

Significant Risks and Uncertainties

 

The Company has a limited operating history. Its business and operations are subject to customary risks and uncertainties associated with dependence on key personnel, competition or change in consumer taste, and the need to obtain additional financing.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates.

 

Significant estimates include the values of services provided in exchange for issuance of stock and accrued liabilities. It is reasonably possible that changes in estimates will occur in the near term.

 

FS-9

 

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

The Company considers all short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible, within three months of origination, to known amounts as cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had no cash equivalents.

 

The Company maintains its cash on deposit with a well-established and widely known bank, which management considers to be financially stable and credit worthy. Deposited cash balances are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000.

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. Applicable accounting guidance provides an established hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the factors that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

 

Level 1- Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

 

Level 2 - Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and

 

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.

 

The fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair-value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of the date of these financial statements. The respective carrying value of all financial instruments approximated their fair values. These financial instruments include SAFE notes (see Note 6). Fair values of these items have been determined to approximate their carrying values because the instruments have been outstanding for a very short time, and market circumstances have not changed materially since the instruments were originated.

 

FS-10

 

 

Income Taxes

 

The Company applies ASC 740 “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740” ). Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial statement reported amounts at each period end, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established , when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The provision for income taxes represents the tax expense for the period, if any, and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company has generated a net loss for the years ending December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and has recorded no current income tax provision.

 

Stock Based Compensation

 

The Company accounts for share-based compensation under the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions, stock-based compensation expense is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, or liabilities incurred, whichever is more reliably measured. Share-based compensation for all stock-based awards to employees and directors is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.

 

The Company accounts for stock compensation arrangements with non-employees in accordance with Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2018-07, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which requires that such equity instruments are recorded at the value on the grant date.

 

Advertising Expenses

 

The Company expenses advertising costs as they are incurred.

 

Selling, General & Administrative Costs

 

The primary components of sales, general & administrative costs are advertising, marketing & business development costs. The Company expenses advertising costs as they are incurred.

 

Research & Development

 

The Company expenses research and development costs as they are incurred. Research and development costs consist primarily of payroll, options expense, personnel costs for engineering, research and product management, prototyping costs, and contract and professional services. Research and developments for the years ending December 31 2021 and 2020 were $2,825,586 and $276,546, respectively.

 

FS-11

 

 

Basic Loss per Share

 

Basic and diluted loss per share are computed based on the weighted-average common shares and common share equivalents outstanding during the period. Except with respect to certain voting, conversion and transfer rights and as otherwise expressly provided in the Company’s Articles of Incorporation or required by applicable law, shares of the Company’s Class A common stock and Class B common stock have the same rights and privileges and rank equally, share ratably and are identical in all respects as to all matters. Accordingly, basic and diluted net income (loss) per share are the same for both classes. Common share equivalents consist of stock options and restricted stock units. Common share equivalents were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, because their effect was anti-dilutive.

 

Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows:

 
                   December 31,         
                   2021                           2020

NOTE 4 - STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

 

Common Stock

 

In September 2021, the Company filed Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which, among other things, (a) authorizes 227,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $0.0001 par value per share, of which, (i) 195,000,000 shares shall be designated “Class A Common Stock,” $0.0001 par value per share, and (ii) 32,000,000 shares shall be designated as “Class B Common Stock,” $0.0001 par value per share, (b) authorize 50,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value per share, and (c) effectuate a ten-for-one (10-for-1) forward split of the Company’s Common Stock. All shares amounts have been retroactively adjusted to show the forward split. The Company increased the authorized number of shares under their Stock Incentive Plan from 10,000,000 to 15,000,000.

 

Each holder of shares of Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to ten (10) votes for each share of Class B Common Stock held as of the applicable date on any matter that is submitted to a vote or for the consent of the stockholders of the Company. Each share of Class B Common Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for such stock, and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock. Each share of Class B Common Stock shall automatically, without any further action, convert into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock upon a transfer of such share, except that if a holder of Class B Common Stock transfers any shares of Class B Common Stock to another holder of Class B Common Stock, then such transfer will not cause the automatic conversion of the transferred shares of Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock.

 

Each holder of shares of Class A Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share of Class A Common Stock held as of the applicable date on any matter that is submitted to a vote or for the consent of the stockholders of the Company. The holders of shares of Class B Common Stock and Class A Common Stock shall at all times vote together as one class on all matters except when otherwise required under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation. Under the Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, any corporate action to be taken by vote of stockholders other than for election of directors shall be authorized by the affirmative vote of the majority of votes cast. Directors are elected by a plurality of votes. Stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights.

 

Preferred Stock

 

The Company’s board of directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, powers, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof. These rights, powers, preferences and privileges could include dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights, liquidation preferences, sinking fund terms and the number of shares constituting any series or the designation of such series, any or all of which may be greater than the rights of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock. The issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock and the likelihood that such holders will receive dividend payments and payments upon liquidation. In addition, the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in the Company’s control or other corporate action.

 

FS-13

 

 

Series A Preferred Stock

 

The Company’s board of directors has used its authority to designate 612,330 shares of preferred stock as “Series A-1 Preferred Stock,” 3,688,700 shares of preferred stock as “Series A-2 Preferred Stock,” 658,800 shares of preferred stock as “Series A-3 Preferred Stock,” 204,280 shares of preferred stock as “Series A-4 Preferred Stock,” 340,000 shares of preferred stock as “Series A-5 Preferred Stock,” and 8,000,000 shares of preferred stock as “Series A-6 Preferred Stock,” with the rights and terms summarized below. The Company collectively refer to the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 Preferred Stock, Series A-3 Preferred Stock, Series A-4 Preferred Stock, Series A-5 Preferred Stock, and Series A-6 Preferred Stock as the “Series A Preferred Stock.” The Company created these six series of Series A Preferred Stock with varying original issue prices that correspond to the six different conversion prices of the Company’s outstanding SAFEs so that the Company could convert all of their outstanding SAFEs into Series A Preferred Stock with the appropriate original issue price as described below.

 

Series A Preferred Stock - Rank

 

Each series of Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to all Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, junior to any other class or series of capital stock of the Company which specifically provides that it will rank senior in preference or priority to the Series A Preferred Stock, on parity with the Company’s other authorized classes of preferred stock, and on parity with any class or series of share capital hereafter created, the terms of which class or series are not expressly subordinated or senior to the Series A Preferred Stock, in each case as to distribution of any asset or property of the Company upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary.

 

Series A Preferred Stock - Voting

 

Shares of Series A Preferred Stock each have one vote and vote together with the holders of Common Stock on an as- converted basis on all matters for which the holders of Common Stock vote at an annual or special meeting of stockholders or act by written consent, and as otherwise required by law.

 

Series A Preferred Stock - Liquidation Rights

 

In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company or a “deemed liquidation event” (as defined below), each holder of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the cash and other assets of the Company available for distribution to its stockholders, prior and in preference to all shares of Common Stock, an amount in cash equal to the aggregate liquidation preference of all shares held by such holder. The shares have a liquidation preference of an amount per share equal to the greater of (a) the Original Issue Price (as defined below) for such share, or (b) such amount per share as would have been payable had all shares of its series of Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock immediately prior to a liquidation , dissolution or winding up or a deemed liquidation event (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization) plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. If upon any liquidation the remaining assets available for distribution are insufficient to pay the holders of Series A Preferred Stock the full preferential amount to which they are entitled, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any distribution of the remaining assets and funds in proportion to the respective full preferential amounts which would otherwise be payable, and our company shall not make or agree to make any payments to the holders of Common Stock. A “deemed liquidation event” means, unless otherwise determined by the holders of at least a majority of each Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis), (a) a sale, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of our assets to a non-affiliate of our company, or (b) a merger, acquisition, change of control, consolidation or other transactions or series of transactions in which the Company’s stockholders prior to such transaction or series of transactions do not retain a majority of the voting power of the surviving entity immediately following such transaction or series of transactions. The Original Issue Price is $2.00 for the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, $0.17 for the Series A-2 Preferred Stock, $0.17 for the Series A-3 Preferred Stock, $0.09 for the Series A-4 Preferred Stock, $0.10 for the Series A-5 Preferred Stock, and $0.01 for the Series A-6 Preferred Stock.

 

FS-14

 

 

Series A Preferred Stock - Dividends

 

The Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions paid on any shares of common stock. Dividends or distributions, if any, may be paid in respect of the Series A Preferred Stock at the sole discretion of the Company’s board.

 

Voluntary Conversion

 

Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible, without any payment, into a number of fully paid and non- assessable shares of Class A Common Stock as is determined by dividing its Original Issue Price by the applicable conversion price, defined as initially equal to the Original Issue Price and subsequently adjusted to reflect the effect of stock splits and combinations, that is in effect at the time of conversion, rounded down to the nearest whole share.

 

Automatic Conversion

 

Upon (i) the closing of an initial public offering, (ii) the date that the Company or a successor to the Company becomes an issuer with a class of securities registered under Section 12 or subject to Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and is subject to the periodic and current reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or (iii) the date and time, or the occurrence of an event, specified by vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of a class of Series A Preferred Stock at the time of such vote or consent, voting as a single class on an as-converted basis, or (iv) upon any acquisition, all outstanding shares of such class of Series A Preferred Stock will automatically be converted into shares of Class A Common Stock, at the applicable ratio described above for voluntary conversions, rounded down to the nearest whole share.

SAFEs

 

Since inception and through December 31, 2020, the Company had raised $843,265 in exchange for several Simple Agreements for Future Equity (collectively, the “SAFEs”) and these amounts have been recorded to additional paid-in capital. During the year ended December 31, 2021, $625,021 of the SAFEs were converted into 3,687,994 shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining amounts related to SAFEs was $217,875. On December 16, 2021, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer exercised his powers as Designated Lead Investor to amend the conversion terms of SAFEs that were issued in exchange for proceeds of $625,390 to allow for their voluntary conversion by the Company for the amounts of shares of preferred stock that were issuable upon the occurrence of a “Qualified Equity Financing” in accordance with the original SAFE terms. The converted SAFEs were then converted into 3,687,994 shares of Series A- 2 Preferred Stock. These shares were granted for no consideration other than the original purchase amounts for the outstanding SAFE instruments. The Company granted these shares to the former SAFE holders pursuant to a private placement exemption from registration requirements

 

As of December 31, 2021, the remaining balance of SAFEs was $217,875. The terms of the remaining SAFEs are below.

 

An amount of $37,625 of the outstanding SAFEs will convert into a number of shares of Safe Preferred Stock equal to $37,625. If there is a Qualified Equity Financing (defined as more than $500,000 worth of shares being purchased) before the expiration or termination of this instrument, the Company will automatically issue to the Investor either: (1) a number of shares of Standard Preferred Stock equal to the Purchase Price divided by the price per share of the Standard Preferred Stock, if the pre-money valuation is less than or equal to the Valuation Cap; or (2) a number of shares of Safe Preferred Stock equal to the Purchase Price divided by the Safe Price, if the pre-money valuation is greater than the Valuation Cap (defined as

$3,500,000).

 

An amount of $15,250 of the outstanding SAFEs from 2019 will convert upon the following terms: If there is a Qualified Equity Financing (defined as more than $300,000 worth of shares being purchased) before the expiration or termination of this instrument, the Company will automatically issue to the Investor either: (1) a number of shares of Standard Preferred Stock equal to the Purchase Price divided by the price per share of the Standard Preferred Stock, if the pre-money valuation is less than or equal to the Valuation Cap; or (2) a number of shares of Safe Preferred Stock equal to the Purchase Price divided by the Safe Price, if the pre - money valuation is greater than the Valuation Cap (defined as $3,500,000).

 

FS-18

 

 

An amount of $50,000 of the outstanding SAFEs from 2019 will convert upon the following terms: If there is a Qualified Equity Financing (defined as more than $300,000 worth of shares being purchased) before the expiration or termination of this instrument, the Company will automatically issue to the Investor either: (1) a number of shares of Standard Preferred Stock equal to the Purchase Price divided by the price per share of the Standard Preferred Stock, if the pre-money valuation is less than or equal to the Valuation Cap; or (2) a number of shares of Safe Preferred Stock equal to the Purchase Price divided by the Safe Price, if the pre-money valuation is greater than the Valuation Cap (defined as $250,000 }.

 

In 2019, the Company has raised an additional $66,000 cash in exchange for several Simple Agreements for Future Equity (collectively, the “2019 SAFEs”) that were worth $115,000; $49,000 of the SAFEs were issued in exchange for advisory services instead of cash. Upon a bona fide transaction or series of transactions with the principal purpose of raising capital, pursuant to which the Company issues and sells preferred stock at a fixed pre-money valuation (an “Equity Financing”), an amount of $115,000 of the outstanding SAFEs will convert into a number of shares of Safe Preferred Stock equal to $115,000. If there is a Qualified Equity Financing (defined as $1,000,000 for $40,000 of the 2019 SAFEs; $1,200,000 for $25,000 of the 2019 SAFEs, $2,000,000 for $50,000 of the 2019 SAFEs worth of shares being purchased) before the expiration or termination of this instrument, the Company will automatically issue to the Investor either : (1) a number of shares of Standard Preferred Stock equal to the Purchase Price divided by the price per share of the Standard Preferred Stock, if the pre-money valuation is less than or equal to the Valuation Cap; or (2) a number of shares of Safe Preferred Stock equal to the Purchase Price divided by the Safe Price, if the pre-money valuation is greater than the Valuation Cap (defined as $7,000,000).

 

NOTE 5 - GOING CONCERN

 

These financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. The Company began operations in 2018 and has incurred losses since Inception. Since Inception, the Company has relied on securing shareholder investments and contributions from the founders. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had not yet generated revenues and will likely continue to incur losses until it is able to begin generating revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. During the next 12 months, the Company intends to fund its operations with additional funding and funds from revenue producing activities, if and when such can be realized. If the Company cannot secure additional short-term capital, it may cease operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is not able to continue as a going concern.

NOTE 6 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

 

In March 2020, the Company inadvertently made an overpayment to our CEO of $67,000. The Company and its CEO did not have knowledge of such overpayment until April 2021 and wished to rectify such overpayment by requiring the CEO to repay the Company the amount of the overpayment. In April 2021 we entered into a loan agreement with the CEO relating to the terms of the repayment by the CEO of the overpayment of $67,000 . Principal and interest on the $67,000 overpayment loan accrue at a rate of 2% and are due on March 30, 2024, and may be prepaid in whole or in part without penalty.

 

GenesisAI’s president was entitled to an annual bonus in the amount of $70,000 under his employment agreement with the Company. He agreed to waive his bonus as partial consideration for the cancellation and exchange of 27,080,000 shares of his Class A Common Stock for the same number of shares of Class B Common Stock (See Note 4).

 

NOTE 7 – PPP LOAN

 

On May 21, 2020, the Company received a Paycheck Protection Program loan of $20,832 bearing interest of 1%. Principal and interest must be repaid on a monthly basis for the 2-year term of the loan. On April 26, 2021, the full amount of the loan was forgiven. The forgiveness has been recorded as other income.

 

NOTE 8 - INCOME TAXES

 

The Company follows the provisions of ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” This standard requires a company to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position. If the more-likely-than-not threshold is met, a company must measure the tax position to determine the amount to recognize in the financial statements. As a result of the implementation of this standard, the Company performed a review of its material tax positions in accordance with recognition and measurement standards established by ASC 740.

 

Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

 

FS-20

 

 

Deferred tax assets and the valuation account are as follows:

 
                   December 31,
2021                           December 31,
2020         
Deferred tax assets:                                                                          
NOL carryover                  $        630,319                                    203,718         
Valuation allowance                           (630,319        )                           (203,718        )
Net deferred tax asset                  $        -                                    -         

 

The income tax provision differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the U.S. federal and state income tax rates of 21% to pretax income from continuing operations for the period ended December 31, 2021.

 

The components of income tax expense for the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:

 
                   December 31,
2021                           December 31,
2020         
                                                         
Book loss                  $        799,853                                    152,217         
Stock-based compensation                           (377,627        )                           -         
Gain on forgiveness of PPP loan                           4,375                                    -         
Change in NOL valuation allowance                           (426,601        )                           (152,217        )
                   $        -                                    -         

 

The Company currently has no issues creating timing differences that would mandate deferred tax expense. Net operating losses would create possible tax assets in future years. Due to the uncertainty of the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards, a valuation allowance has been made to the extent of any tax benefit that net operating losses may generate. A provision for income taxes has not been made due to net operating loss carry-forwards of $3,001,519 as of December 31, 2021, which may be offset against future taxable income. No tax benefit has been reported in the financial statements.

 

The Company did not have any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.

 

The Company includes interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations in the provision for income taxes. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

 

All tax years since inception remain subject to examination by major taxing jurisdictions.

 

NOTE 9 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

 

The Company has evaluated subsequent events from December 31, 2021, through Apri 11, 2022, the date when the financial statements were available to be issued and has determined the following items needed to be disclosed:

 
        ●        The Company issued 889,538 stock options to and employee at an exercise price of $2.00. The stock options will expire after 10 years and began vesting on January 3, 2022 at a rate of 1/48 on a monthly basis over the four year term of the award.

+Installing the Sun Java JDK
+
+When you install the Sun Java SDK, you must install it to a path that does not have any spaces.
+
+To install the Sun Java SDK:
+
+Double-click the JDK installer file that you downloaded (jdk-6u43-windows-x64.exe).
+
+The welcome page of the JDK installation wizard is displayed.
+
+
+￼
+
+On the welcome page, click Next.
+
+On the Custom Setup page, because the default installation location (under Program Files) has a space, you must change it here. To change the JDK installation location:
+
+￼
+
+Click the Change button.
+
+In the Folder name field, remove the Program Files directory. This changes the location to: C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_43\
+
+￼
+
+Click OK.
+
+On the Custom Setup page, verify that the installation location has been updated, then click Next.
+
+￼
+
+The Destination Folder page sets the location of the public JRE. Because this JRE is not used by Endeca Information Discovery, you can leave the default directory. Click Next.
+
+￼
+
+The installation process begins.
+
+When the installation is completed, click Finish.

+Installing the Sun Java JDK
+
+When you install the Sun Java SDK, you must install it to a path that does not have any spaces.
+
+To install the Sun Java SDK:
+
+Double-click the JDK installer file that you downloaded (jdk-6u43-windows-x64.exe).
+
+The welcome page of the JDK installation wizard is displayed.
+
+
+￼
+
+On the welcome page, click Next.
+
+On the Custom Setup page, because the default installation location (under Program Files) has a space, you must change it here. To change the JDK installation location:
+
+￼
+
+Click the Change button.
+
+In the Folder name field, remove the Program Files directory. This changes the location to: C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_43\
+
+￼
+
+Click OK.
+
+On the Custom Setup page, verify that the installation location has been updated, then click Next.
+
+￼
+
+The Destination Folder page sets the location of the public JRE. Because this JRE is not used by Endeca Information Discovery, you can leave the default directory. Click Next.
+
+￼
+
+The installation process begins.
+
+When the installation is completed, click Finish.

Installing the Sun Java JDK

When you install the Sun Java SDK, you must install it to a path that does not have any spaces.

To install the Sun Java SDK:

Double-click the JDK installer file that you downloaded (jdk-6u43-windows-x64.exe).

The welcome page of the JDK installation wizard is displayed.


￼

On the welcome page, click Next.

On the Custom Setup page, because the default installation location (under Program Files) has a space, you must change it here. To change the JDK installation location:

￼

Click the Change button.

In the Folder name field, remove the Program Files directory. This changes the location to: C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_43\

￼

Click OK.

On the Custom Setup page, verify that the installation location has been updated, then click Next.

￼

The Destination Folder page sets the location of the public JRE. Because this JRE is not used by Endeca Information Discovery, you can leave the default directory. Click Next.

￼

The installation process begins.

When the installation is completed, click Finish.

+Installing the Sun Java JDK

+

+When you install the Sun Java SDK, you must install it to a path that does not have any spaces.

+

+To install the Sun Java SDK:

+

+Double-click the JDK installer file that you downloaded (jdk-6u43-windows-x64.exe).

+

+The welcome page of the JDK installation wizard is displayed.

+

+

+￼

+

+On the welcome page, click Next.

+

+On the Custom Setup page, because the default installation location (under Program Files) has a space, you must change it here. To change the JDK installation location:

+

+￼

+

+Click the Change button.

+

+In the Folder name field, remove the Program Files directory. This changes the location to: C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_43\

+

+￼

+

+Click OK.

+

+On the Custom Setup page, verify that the installation location has been updated, then click Next.

+

+￼

+

+The Destination Folder page sets the location of the public JRE. Because this JRE is not used by Endeca Information Discovery, you can leave the default directory. Click Next.

+

+￼

+

+The installation process begins.

+

+When the installation is completed, click Finish.

+Installing the Sun Java JDK

+

+When you install the Sun Java SDK, you must install it to a path that does not have any spaces.

+

+To install the Sun Java SDK:

+

+Double-click the JDK installer file that you downloaded (jdk-6u43-windows-x64.exe).

+

+The welcome page of the JDK installation wizard is displayed.

+

+

+￼

+

+On the welcome page, click Next.

+

+On the Custom Setup page, because the default installation location (under Program Files) has a space, you must change it here. To change the JDK installation location:

+

+￼

+

+Click the Change button.

+

+In the Folder name field, remove the Program Files directory. This changes the location to: C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_43\

+

+￼

+

+Click OK.

+

+On the Custom Setup page, verify that the installation location has been updated, then click Next.

+

+￼

+

+The Destination Folder page sets the location of the public JRE. Because this JRE is not used by Endeca Information Discovery, you can leave the default directory. Click Next.

+

+￼

+

+The installation process begins.

+

+When the installation is completed, click Finish.

Installing the Sun Java JDK

When you install the Sun Java SDK, you must install it to a path that does not have any spaces.

To install the Sun Java SDK:

Double-click the JDK installer file that you downloaded (jdk-6u43-windows-x64.exe).

The welcome page of the JDK installation wizard is displayed.

￼

On the welcome page, click Next.

On the Custom Setup page, because the default installation location (under Program Files) has a space, you must change it here. To change the JDK installation location:

￼

Click the Change button.

In the Folder name field, remove the Program Files directory. This changes the location to: C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_43\

￼

Click OK.

On the Custom Setup page, verify that the installation location has been updated, then click Next.

￼

The Destination Folder page sets the location of the public JRE. Because this JRE is not used by Endeca Information Discovery, you can leave the default directory. Click Next.

￼

The installation process begins.

When the installation is completed, click Finish.
