   * Position in a text document expressed as zero-based line and character
   * offset. Prior to 3.17 the offsets were always based on a UTF-16 string
   * representation. So a string of the form `a𐐀b` the character offset of the
   * character `a` is 0, the character offset of `𐐀` is 1 and the character
   * offset of b is 3 since `𐐀` is represented using two code units in UTF-16.
   * Since 3.17 clients and servers can agree on a different string encoding
   * representation (e.g. UTF-8). The client announces it's supported encoding
   * via the client capability [`general.positionEncodings`](#clientCapabilities).
   * The value is an array of position encodings the client supports, with
   * decreasing preference (e.g. the encoding at index `0` is the most preferred
   * one). To stay backwards compatible the only mandatory encoding is UTF-16
   * represented via the string `utf-16`. The server can pick one of the
   * encodings offered by the client and signals that encoding back to the
   * client via the initialize result's property
   * [`capabilities.positionEncoding`](#serverCapabilities). If the string value
   * `utf-16` is missing from the client's capability `general.positionEncodings`
   * servers can safely assume that the client supports UTF-16. If the server
   * omits the position encoding in its initialize result the encoding defaults
   * to the string value `utf-16`. Implementation considerations: since the
   * conversion from one encoding into another requires the content of the
   * file / line the conversion is best done where the file is read which is
   * usually on the server side.
   *
   * Positions are line end character agnostic. So you can not specify a position
   * that denotes `\r|\n` or `\n|` where `|` represents the character offset.
   *
   * @since 3.17.0 - support for negotiated position encoding.
