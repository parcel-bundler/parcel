# Welcome to your VS Code Extension

## Get up and running straight away

- Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
- Set breakpoints in your code inside `src/extension.ts` to debug your extension.
- Find output from your extension in the debug console.
- Run Atlaspack in a project with `--reporter @atlaspack/reporter-lsp`

## Make changes

- You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after changing code in `src/extension.ts`.
